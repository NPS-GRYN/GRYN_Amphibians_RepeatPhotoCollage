# GRYN_Amphibians_RepeatPhotoCollage

This repository contains an R-markdown file that walks through the steps to create a tiled PDF summary of all the repeat photo points taken at a given wetland site.

The REcommended Folder Structure for these prjects are as follows:

The parent catchment folder (i.e. RepeatPhotos_544_GardnerHole), contains sub-directories for each year (544_2006, 544_2007, 544_2008...)
Within the folder for a given year are the jpg files that are the actual images.

All images you want to use must all be labeled with the following convention: 
Catchment-Site_pp_X_bearing_yyyymmdd.jpg

An example file name would be: 4170-1_pp_a_080_20060627.jpg
